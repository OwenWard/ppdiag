Description: A suite of diagnostic tools for univariate point processes.
    This includes tools for simulating and fitting both common and more
    complex temporal point processes. We also include functions to 
    visualise these point processes and collect existing diagnostic
    tools which can be used to assess the fit of a chosen point process
    model.
