#' snadv: A package for diagnosis and visualizations in social network analysis
#'
#' sandv provides a flexible grammar of social network model diagnosis. It focus on visualization tools,
#' intensity calculation, inspection of log likelihhood and pearson residuals.
#' 
#' @section snadv has three main goals:
#'  - Check the model fit by visualizing pearson residuals, qq plots on rescaled time events and intensity 
#'    plots.
