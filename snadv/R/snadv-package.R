#' snadv: A package for diagnosis and visualizations in social network analysis
#'
#' The model checking process is an important part in the social network analysis.
#' sandv provides a flexible grammar of social network model diagnosis. It focus on visualization tools,
#' intensity calculation, inspection of log likelihhood and pearson residuals.
#'
#' @section main goals:
#'  - Check the model fit by visualizing pearson residuals, qq plots on rescaled time events and intensity
#'    plots.
#'
#'  - Evaluate the model by calculating the log likelihood and residuals.
#'
