# Contributing to ppdiag development

Bug reports and any potential problems with any existing code can be addressed
by filing an issue giving some brief details and if possible
a small reproducible example. If you would like to fix the bug 
yourself and it is a small fix, feel free to go ahead with a direct
pull request. Larger issues might be better proceeded by some discussion.

We would be delighted for anyone who is interested in contributing to
this package to get involved also. Potential additions would be to extend the
included diagnostic tests to other point processes, such as different
Hawkes kernel functions. 

To contribute, please look at the existing code and feel free to file
an issue to discuss further any potential additions.

Please note that ppdiag is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this project,
